Abstract Algebra is the study of Algebraic Structures.

## Algebraic Structures

An Algebraic Structure on a set $A$ is a collection of operations on $A$.
These terms will be defined and studied in the following articles.

## Operations
An $n$-ary operation on a set $A$ is a function $\ast: A^n \rightarrow A$
<br/>
$n$ is then called the arity of the operation $\ast$ and the set $A$ is said to be
closed under the operation $\ast$ because each "combination" of elements of $A$
by $\ast$ produces another element of $A$ (Because $\ast$ is a function from $A^n$ to $A$ - $\ast\left(\cdots\right) \in A$).
